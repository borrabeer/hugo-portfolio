      I am a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for web and game development. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle. I am a quick learner and a problem solver, and I enjoy working in a fast-paced and collaborative environment.

      I have contribute to an open-source project called [Transmutation](https://github.com/spellbook-technology/transmutation) which is a Ruby gem that provides a simple way to serialize Ruby objects into JSON.

      I have been using these skills lately, but there are also other skills that I haven't added to the list. However, I am always eager to learn new skills and programming languages.
